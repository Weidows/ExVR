### data.json

The `data.json` file, located in the root (`./`) directory, contains the initial settings for the virtual experience, including position, rotation, and blend shapes.

- **Position**: Defines the 3D coordinates for the head position.
- **Rotation**: Specifies the head rotation around the axes.
- **BlendShapes**: Contains various facial expressions.
- **LeftHandPosition** / **RightHandPosition**: Specifies the positions of the hands.
- **LeftHandRotation** / **RightHandRotation**: Defines the rotation of the hands.
- **LeftHandFinger** / **RightHandFinger**: Controls the movement of each finger.

Each entry contains the following:
- **k**: Key (the name of the property).
- **v**: Default value for the property.
- **s**: Offset value used for adjustment.
- **e**: Enable flag (`true` or `false`) to activate or deactivate the setting.

### smoothing.json

The `smoothing.json` file, located in the root (`./`) directory, contains parameters for smoothing various movements and blend shapes.

- **OtherBlendShapes**: Controls smoothing for general facial blend shapes.
- **EyeBlink**: Adjusts the responsiveness of eye blinking.
- **EyeLook**: Smooths eye movement, including gaze direction.
- **TongueOut**: Controls the tongue-out animation smoothing.
- **TongueMove**: Smooths left and right tongue movements.
- **HeadPosition**: Manages smoothing for head position adjustments.
- **HeadRotation**: Smooths head rotation movements.
- **LeftHandPosition** / **RightHandPosition**: Adjusts hand position smoothing.
- **LeftHandRotation** / **RightHandRotation**: Manages the smoothness of hand rotations.
- **LeftHandFinger** / **RightHandFinger**: Controls smoothing for individual finger movements.

If you are not developing the application, avoid modifying the following fields:
- **key**: Identifies the target property.
- **is_rotation**: Indicates if the property is a rotation.
- **indices**: Specifies the relevant data indices.
- **shifting**: Indices shifting.

You **can modify** the following settings to fine-tune the experience:
- **max_delta**: Maximum allowed change in value. Higher values make movements more sensitive but can introduce jitter.
- **deadzone**: The range within which small movements are ignored. A larger dead zone reduces jitter but may make movements feel less smooth.
- **dt_multiplier**: Smoothing factor. Smaller values produce smoother movements but may slow down responsiveness.

### hotkeys.json

The `hotkeys.json` file, located in the root (`./`) directory, defines all the available keyboard and mouse shortcuts for interacting. You can modify this file to customize.
